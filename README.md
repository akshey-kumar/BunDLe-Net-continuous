# BunDLe-Net-continuous

Behavioural and Dynamic Learning Network (BunDLe Net) is an algorithm to learn meaningful coarse-grained representations from time-series data. It maps high-dimensional data to low-dimensional space while preserving both dynamical and behavioural information. It has been applied, but is not limited, to neuronal manifold learning. 

This is an implementation of the BunDLe-Net architecture for continuous-valued and multidimensional behaviours. In `notebooks/`, you can find BunDLe-Net deployed on rat and primate electrophysiological data which forms part of the results for the journal paper:[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.08.551978v2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.08.551978v2)
